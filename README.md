**Description**
This is the first iteration of a machine-learning model for facial recognition. 
This model is based on learnings from 'Lab 9: Machine Learning' in the Carnegie Mellon University course '18-100: Introduction to Electrical Computer Engineering,' taught by Gregory Kesden and Tom Kedjel. 
This model is made by Jai Sengupta.

**Reflection**
The model works well for detection of faces and eyes, but seems to struggle in detecting mouths, as it gives false positives often. 
The feature is turned off below, but I will look towards Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + Linear SVM for my next model.
